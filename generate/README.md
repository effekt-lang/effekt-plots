# Generators

These bash scripts generate the `.json` data files in `../data`. You can generate all data files by running `./main.sh`.

## Descriptions

- `append.sh`: Appends new data to existing `.json` files. It also adds a `meta` section that annotates the current commit and date.
- `backends.sh`: Combines the data generated by `benchmarks.sh` into a JSON
- `benchmarks.sh`: Measures the (phase-)time for selected benchmarks. By using `gnutime`, it also measures CPU and memory usage.
- `build.sh`: Builds and installs `effekt`. It also measures the time it took.
- `cloc.sh`: Counts the lines of code in the `../effekt/` repository using `cloc`.
- `metrics.sh`: Combines the time, CPU and memory usage data generated by `benchmarks.sh` into a single JSON.
- `phases.sh`: Combines the files generated by Effekt's `--time json` flag into a single JSON.
